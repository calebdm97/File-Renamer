# File Renamer
Python code that I created to rename multiple files in a directory. Useful for when I am needing to rename multiple files in a similar fashion.

This program is a contstant work in progress with the goal being able to customize in great detailhow the different files get renamed and logic to attempt to guess what kind of files are being renamed and how the user wants to rename them.
